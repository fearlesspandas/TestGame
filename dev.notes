Goal:
	Simplify and abstract the entity movement/positioning
approach:
	1. remove method calls on specific class properties, and replace with a 		generalized dict with fields we can define outside the coordinat		ion logic
`	2. Reduce NetworkManager to generalized methods regarding property updates
	3. redefine client behavior to use the abstracted properties dict
	4. redefine server behavior to use the simpler network manager logic 
		with field calls rather than hyper specific methods
